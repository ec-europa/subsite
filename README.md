<p>Open Social tailored for the European Commission</p>

This is an example, feel free to drop it and customize as you need.

## 1. Development

### 1.1 Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your local development
environment: [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git),
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1.2 Configuring the project

The project ships with default configuration in the `runner.yml.dist` file. This
file is configured to run the website on the provided docker containers. If you
are happy using those, you can skip directly to the [installing the project](#14-installing-the-project)
section. You can customize the default configuration by copying `runner.yml.dist`
to `runner.yml` and changing for example the connection details for your
database server and selenium server.

### 1.3 Setting up the environment

By default, docker-compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an
optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file. By convention, the `docker-compose.yml`
contains your base configuration and it is committed to the repository. This
file contains a webserver, a mysql server and a selenium server. It very closely
matches the environment the website is deployed on.

The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for
existing services or it can add entirely new services. This file is never
committed to the repository.

#### 1.3.1 Make your life easier with aliases

You can shorten the commands listed below by setting an alias in your `.bashrc`
file:
```bash
alias dcup="dc up -d"
alias dcweb="dc exec web "
```

### 1.4 Installing the project

```bash
# Run composer install in the web service.
docker-compose exec web composer install
# Build your development instance of the website.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:build-dev
# Perform a clean installation of the website.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:install-clean
# Or alternatively perform a clean installation of the website in
# development mode. This will automatically disable caching and enable
# development modules like devel, devel_generate and kint.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:install-clean-dev
# Perform a clone installation with production data.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:install-clone
# Or alternatively perform a clone installation with production data in
# development mode. This will automatically disable caching and enable
# development modules like devel, devel_generate and kint.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:install-clone-dev
```

Using default configuration your Drupal site will be available locally at:
- [http://127.0.0.1:8080/web](http://127.0.0.1:8080/web)
  - does not support EU Login
  - no http auth by default

**NOTE:** If Cloud9 is used for the project development, when
setting up a project there it will be available at either:
- [https://|your-c9-username|.c9.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/web](https://|your-c9-username|.c9.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/web)
  - supports EU Login
  - http auth by default (request credentials with a teammember)
- [https://|aws-machine-id|.vfs.cloud9.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web](https://|aws-machine-id|.vfs.cloud9.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web)
  - does not support EU Login
  - protected by C9 session


### 1.5 Testing the project

```bash
# Run coding standard checks
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:test-phpcs
# Run behat tests on a clean installation.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:test-behat
# Run behat tests on a clone installation.
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run toolkit:test-behat -D "behat.tags=@clone"
```

### 1.6 Updating composer.lock

When having a conflict on the composer.lock file it is best to solve the conflict
manually and then update the lock file.

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer update --lock
```
