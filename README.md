also contains tools for Quality Assurance.</p>

## Installation Drupal 7
The build system for NextEuropa projects is packaged in a toolkit that can
be found here: [ec-europa/toolkit](https://github.com/ec-europa/toolkit#user-guide). This is
the only required composer package to set up your project. To initiate a new
project you can execute the following command:

```bash
composer create-project ec-europa/subsite project-folder-name dev-release/3.x --no-interaction
```

This will clone the current repository and install the toolkit. After this is done
the .git/ files of the template repository will be removed. This sets up a clean
toolkit that you can `git init` your own project on. For any information on toolkit
usage, please refer to its documentation: [ec-europa/toolkit](https://github.com/ec-europa/toolkit#user-guide)
